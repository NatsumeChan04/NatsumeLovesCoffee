- Hi, I’m @NatsumeLovesCoffee, but you can just call me Natsume
- I’m interested in science, art, books, and gaming.
- I’m currently learning digital art, violin, a few languages, and chemistry.
- I’m looking to collaborate on any art projects with other artists, or science projects too involving chemistry or dissecting.
